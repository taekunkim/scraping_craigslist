# Let's Scrape Craigslist!

## Objective

**I will be recording the name, id, date posted, image url, location sold, price, and the url of every listing of desk chairs sold on Craigslist - San Diego, CA.**

Recently, I had a sudden need to buy a new desk chair.
While frequently browsing Craigslist, I wondered how frequently sellers change their listing prices
and for how long they keep their listings posted!
So, I decided to learn how to webscrape Craigslist.

## Tools

I used Python, BeautifulSoup, and CronTab.
